## Description

The Social Network API is a backend application designed for a social media platform, allowing users to share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Built with Express.js and MongoDB using the Mongoose ODM, this API efficiently handles large amounts of unstructured data. The API supports CRUD operations for users, thoughts, reactions, and friend lists.

## Usage

The API provides the following routes for managing users, thoughts, reactions, and friend lists:

-   **Users**:

    -   `GET /api/users`: Get all users.
    -   `GET /api/users/:userId`: Get a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data.
    -   `POST /api/users`: Create a new user.
    -   `PUT /api/users/:userId`: Update a user by its `_id`.
    -   `DELETE /api/users/:userId`: Delete a user by its `_id`.

-   **User Friend List**:

    -   `POST /api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`: Add a new friend to a user's friend list.
    -   `DELETE /api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`: Remove a friend from a user's friend list.

-   **Thoughts**:

    -   `GET /api/thoughts`: Get all thoughts.
    -   `GET /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`: Get a single thought by its `_id`.
    -   `POST /api/thoughts`: Create a new thought.
    -   `PUT /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`: Update a thought by its `_id`.
    -   `DELETE /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`: Delete a thought by its `_id`.

-   **Reactions**:
    -   `POST /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`: Create a reaction stored in a single thought's `reactions` array field.

## Tests

To test the application, use Insomnia or a similar API client to perform the following:

-   Start the server and ensure it connects to the MongoDB database.
-   Test all `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes for users and thoughts.
-   Test the `POST` and `DELETE` routes for reactions and friend lists.

Verify that all operations perform as expected and that the data is correctly formatted.
